# MSA Exploit Checker

Before I give an explanation of what this project is, I'd like to make it clear that
the Microsoft account "exploit" is not an official exploit, however it's a feature
that can easily be abused to regain control of a compromised account if the account
is recovered.

### How the "exploit" works

If a device is added as a FIDO enabled device on a Microsoft account, the normal measures
of securing an account aren't enough to remove the device. This allows an attacker that
has previously had access to the Microsoft account to regain access to it easily, as
long as they added a FIDO enabled device to it.

### How the detection works

The application works by replicating an account login request and checking if
the response contains any FIDO information. If it does have FIDO information, then
the "exploit" has been added to the account.

### Project structure

The project is divided into two different modules, the API and the Discord bot.

The Discord bot can be added to a server, and you can do `/check (email)` to
see if the email is FIDO enabled.

### Installation

- Clone the repository
- Install the dependencies (`pip install requirements.txt`)
- Create an environment variables file with the following fields:
    - HOST (usually 127.0.0.1)
    - PORT
    - BOT_TOKEN (your bot token)
- Execute `py .`
